# Dictionary is an ordered set of a key-value pair of items. It is like an associative array or a hash table where each key stores a specific value. Key can hold any primitive data type whereas value is an arbitrary Python object.

# The items in the dictionary are separated with the comma and enclosed in the curly braces {}.


d = {1:'Jimmy', 2:'Alex', 3:'john', 4:'mike'}
print("1st name is "+d[1])# '+' use for concatenation
print("2nd name is "+ d[4])
print(d)
print(d.keys())
print(d.values())
