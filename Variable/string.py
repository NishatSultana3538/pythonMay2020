# In python, we can use single, double, or triple quotes to define a string.
str1 = 'hello javatpoint' #string str1
str2 =  "how are you" #string str2
str3 =  '"how are you"' #string str3
print (str1[0:2]) #printing first two character using slice operator
print (str1[4]) #printing 4th character of the string
print (str1*2) #printing the string twice
print (str1 + str2) #printing the concatenation of str1 and str2
print(str3)


# String handling in python is a straightforward task since there are various inbuilt functions and operators provided.
# In the case of string handling, the operator + is used to concatenate two strings as the operation "hello"+" python" returns "hello python".
# The operator * is known as repetition operator as the operation "Python " *2 returns "Python Python ".
